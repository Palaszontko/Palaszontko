<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Olgierd :wave:</h1>

## About me

Since my first automation project, I have been passionate about creating *things that do things*. 

Besides that, I'm developing my skills to become a full-stack developer.

## A short story about my programming journey

My **programming adventure** began when I realized that asking friends to register from a reflink just to get some premium points was pretty pathetic. So I decided to create something that would do it "by itself".

And that's how I discovered **Python** <img src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/python-5.svg" width="16px"> and began to take my first steps in it.

## Currently 
 - :brain: Learning go <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/v2.15.1/icons/go/go-original.svg" width="22px">
 - 🫶 Looking to collaborate on any project using go/js/python! 
 - 🎓 Studying at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology in Warsaw 🇵🇱🇯🇵
