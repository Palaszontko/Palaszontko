<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Olgierd :wave:</h1>

<h2>About me</h2>

Since my first automation project, I have been passionate about creating *things that do things*. 

Besides that, I'm developing my skills to become a full-stack developer.

<h2>A short story about my programming journey</h2>

My **programming adventure** began when I realized that asking friends to register from a reflink just to get some premium points was pretty pathetic. So I decided to create something that would do it "by itself".

And that's how I discovered **Python** <img src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/python-5.svg" width="16px"> and began to take my first steps in it.
